Assignment 2 - Part 1

Question 1
-----------
`g++ primes.c -o primes` to compile the code. `./primes <value of n>` (`./primes 100`) to run the code. Binary attached in submission. (For `gcc`, use the `-std=gnu99` flag)

Question 2
-----------
Run `python generate.py` to generate sample input data. The binary assumes files are named `1.txt` to `10.txt`. (This can be changed by editing `filename_list.txt`). Make sure `filename_list.txt` and input files are in folder where binary is called from.

`g++ -pthread vote-count.c -o vote-count` to compile the code. `./vote-count` to run the code. Binary attached in submission. (For `gcc`, use the `-std=gnu99` flag)
